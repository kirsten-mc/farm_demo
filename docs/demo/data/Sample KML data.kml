      <description>Ground was broken in late summer of 2017 in this plot. It has previously been a fallow field not grazed, or hayed. The plot was cover cropped with oats and peas, and buck wheat for 1 full season before transitioning into production in 2019. 1 manure spreader load of chicken litter was applied to increase fertility as well as an application of lyme for a PH adjustment. Heavy deer pressure in the field. Fencing is needed for any crops considered as browsing stock by deer. Plot was sub soiled in summer of 2019 to improve poor drainage.</description>
