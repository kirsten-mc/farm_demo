1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
KML files represent geographic data in tools such as Google Earth,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,366
and they can represent one or more Areas in farmOS

3
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:13,666
To import into farmOS, copy your KML xml to the clipboard

4
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:17,866
And go to the Areas page, Area importer tab.

5
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:20,399
Paste in your xml

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,866
and choose a Default area type.

7
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:25,566
You can change this later for individual areas.

8
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:28,599
Once Parsed,

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,900
you can edit each of the areas, refining the Name, Area type, Description or Geometry.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,666
If there are several areas in your KML file,

11
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,499
you can choose which to import.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,433
You can also create a new parent area,

13
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:45,199
to keep your geometries organized.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,500
Create areas,

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,000
and review your import.
